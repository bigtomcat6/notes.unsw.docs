## Linear Algebra Assessments

|Task|Weeks|Weighting|
|---|---|---|
|Online quizzes|Due weeks 3, 7 (for Algebra) |20%|
|2 Tests| Week 9 (for Algebra)|20%|
|Final Exam|Exam period|60%|

The deadlines for the linear algebra **online quizzes** will be clearly stated on MÃ¶bius. Deadlines will not be extended under normal circumstances.

The **algebra test** will be held in Week 9 during a lecture hour. Details will be available on Moodle by Week 7.

 The linear algebra part of the **final examination** will contribute half of the marks for the final examination.
 
 Note that to pass MATH2099, **you must obtain a mark of at least 40% in both the linear algebra strand and the statistics strand.**
